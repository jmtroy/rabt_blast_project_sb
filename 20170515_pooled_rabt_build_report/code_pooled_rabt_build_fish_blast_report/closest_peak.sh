# decorate "file to update" with closest peak
# assume that file to update is t a .bed file
# create another file with the closest peaks

# This script finds the closest H3K4ME3 peak to each exon.
# The 1st input is just the output folder path
# The 2nd input is the FILE_TO_UPDATE with mouse exons 
# The 3rd input is the HDR_TO_UPDATE with the column headers of FILE_TO_UPDATE
# The 4th input is the PEAK file from homer with h3k4me3 peaks
# The 5th input is the data set name

# The peak file was created by merge_anno_peak_pos_files.sh called earlier in the process
# (merge_anno_peak_pos_files.sh is called in the main script and merges 2 homer files into one and does formatting)

# The format of the H3K4ME3_PEAK_FILE file is
# 1 chrom  (1,2,3,...)
# 2 start
# 3 end
# 4 homer id/name
# 5 empty (".")
# 6 strand / meaningless
# 7 annotation from homer
# 8 findPeaks score from homer
# 9 Fold Change vs Control (from Homer)
# 10 p-value vs Control (from Homer)
